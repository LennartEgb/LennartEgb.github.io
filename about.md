# Hey
I am Lennart and I develop apps.

I'm enthusiastic to solve problems with programs.
I started Android development in my bachelor thesis in 2017.
At that time I built a prototype of a configuration app for the Aroio hardware audio streamer by [Abacus electronics](https://www.abacus-electronics.de/).

Parallel to the Android client, I am building the REST API that is running on the streamer.
All related code can be found on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/aroio).

If your company is searching for a thrilled Android developer, check out my [resume](/resume) and contact me via [mail](mailto:lennartegbers@hotmail.com).
